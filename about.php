      True Folk TV was formed to help create a space where artists can not only promote their work,
      but speak on subjects concerning the whole independent community. Through interviews, editorials,
      reviews, and general conversation, TFTV hopes to create an atmosphere where all folks can contribute
      to shaping independent culture.

      The TFTV Podcast gives the listener the opportunity to delve deeper
      into the conversations we have with our guests and artists. The podcast is a vehicle for our guests
      to give their in-depth perspective on certain aspects of culture and industry.
